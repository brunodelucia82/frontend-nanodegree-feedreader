# Project Overview

This project contains a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.


## Instructions

This project includes [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for testing. The test suites are in the /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file.

The test will automatically run whenever the index.html file is open. You'll see the test results at the bottom of the page. To re-run a specific suite of tests just click on its name (suite names are displayed in black), to re-run a specific test just click on the test's name. Tests names are displayed either in teal or red depending on whether they passed/failed.

If you want to create your own tests and/or suites edit the /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file. 

To get an idea of how the project works check out **./index.html**, **./css/style.css** and **./js/app.js**. The project also uses [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for templating.
